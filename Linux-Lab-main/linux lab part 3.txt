## ✅ **1. Users in Linux**

A **user** in Linux represents an individual account, and each user can be assigned specific **permissions** to access files, execute programs, and interact with the system.

### Types of Users:

1. **Root User (Superuser)**

   * **Username**: `root`
   * **ID**: `UID 0` (The user ID for `root` is always 0)
   * **Role**: The most powerful user on the system. Has **full control** over the system, can modify anything, and execute any command.
   * **Privileges**: Can access, modify, and delete any file, even system files.

2. **Normal User**

   * Regular users who have access only to their files and certain system files.
   * **ID**: Assigned a unique `UID` starting from `1000` (typically, depending on your Linux distribution).
   * **Role**: Can execute commands, edit files, and access files in their home directories.
   * **Privileges**: They are restricted by permissions (e.g., they can’t access or modify files owned by the root user unless granted explicit permission).

3. **System User**

   * **UID**: Typically lower than `1000`.
   * **Role**: Used by system services and processes. These users don't log in directly, but are associated with daemons or background services like **www-data** (for web servers) or **mysql** (for the MySQL service).
   * **Privileges**: Limited access for service operation purposes.
