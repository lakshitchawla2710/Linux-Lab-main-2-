# 🧠 Extra Questions
## Q1->Difference between $1, $@, and $# in bash?
### A1->In Bash 🐚, $1 represents the first command-line argument 👤. $@ holds all arguments as separate words 📂, useful for iteration. $# gives the total number of arguments 🔢. Together, they help scripts process inputs flexibly, manage lists of parameters, and validate expected argument counts efficiently ⚙️.
---
## Q2->What does exit 1 mean in a script?
### A2->In a script 📝, exit 1 terminates execution 🚪 and signals an error or abnormal condition ⚠️. By convention, exit 0 means success ✅, while any non-zero value (like 1) represents failure. This return code 🔢 helps other programs or users understand the script’s outcome and handle errors gracefully.
