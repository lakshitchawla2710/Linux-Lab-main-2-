## 🧠 Q1️⃣ What are two advantages of installing Ubuntu in VirtualBox?
### 💡 Ans 1️⃣ Free and open source > strong security and less vulnerable to viruses > Regular updates and community support.


## 📝 Q2️⃣ What are two advantages of dual booting instead of using a VM?
### 💡 Ans 1️⃣ Better Performance (Full Hardware Access)

When dual booting, the operating system runs natively on the hardware — not inside another OS. This gives you:

Full access to CPU, RAM, GPU, and disk speeds

No virtualization overhead, which can slow things down in a VM

Much better performance for resource-heavy tasks, like gaming, compiling code, or using GPU-intensive apps

2️⃣ Greater Hardware Compatibility & Stability

Running an OS directly (via dual boot) avoids issues that VMs sometimes have with:

GPU acceleration, USB passthrough, or advanced hardware features

Driver limitations or incompatibilities in the virtualized environment

Certain apps or tools (like low-level utilities or firmware updaters) that won’t work properly in a VM
