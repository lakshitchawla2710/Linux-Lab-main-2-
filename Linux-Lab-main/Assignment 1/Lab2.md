# 🧠 Extra Questions
## Q1->What is the purpose of #!/bin/bash at the top of a script?
### A1->The line #!/bin/bash 🧠, called a shebang, tells the system which interpreter ⚙️ to use for executing the script 📝. It ensures commands run in the specified shell 💻 (here, Bash). Without it, the script may run in a different shell, causing errors or unexpected behavior 🚫.
---
## Q2->How do you make a script executable?
### A2->To make a script executable 📝⚙️, use the chmod command. For example: chmod +x script.sh grants execute permission ✅. After this, run it with ./script.sh 💻. Without execution rights, the system won’t allow direct running 🚫. This step ensures the script behaves like a program for users 👤.
